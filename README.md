# Private-Chat-Application

## Description:
Communication is the cornerstone of the Internet. From it's infancy as a group of message boards the birth of the Internet has seen constant evolution of the tool we use to communicate. From IRC to ICQ to AIM to MSN to MySpace to Facebook to SnapChat it has been a constant evolution of ways in which we communicate. However, along the way we have lost some of ourselves, we have lost our privacy. Massive companies now suck up every bit of information they can in order to gain value. We are no longer paying for products we are the products. This application will attempt to solve some of those issues. We offer the ability to have end-to-end encryption where messages can only be decrypted for their intended recipients and messages will never be stored only forwarded on the server side. There are currently applications that do this on a message by message basis however the novel idea here is that this application will be more of a chat versus a messenger application. This is accomplished with the ability to keep a central repository of users and rooms that users can join, which will allow various levels of privacy and security. Also, a realtime chat option where users are able to stream chat messages live as the participants type them and then slowly fade from existence after 60 seconds disappearing forever (barring screenshots!).
